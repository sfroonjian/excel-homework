### **Excel Homework: Kickstart My Chart Conclusion/Analysis**

Given the provided data, there are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns. First, we can conclude that the category with the most amount of kickstarter campaigns is theater. Also, while theater kickstarters have the most **amount** of successful campaigns, music kickstarters have the highest **percentage** of successful campaigns. The second conclusion we can draw is the subcategory with the most amount of kickstarter campaigns are plays. Finally, we can conclude that more kickstarter campaigns succeed than fail or get canceled. Campaigns are the most successful in May, and they are the least successful in December.

One limitation of this dataset is the small sample size. Only about 4,000 out of more than 300,000 projects were used in this study, which is less than 1.33% of the population size. Another limitation is that about 74% of the kickstarters are from the U.S., while the remaining 26% are from a variety of other countries, which means the data was not gathered evenly across the population.

One possible table/graph that we could create would display how many campaigns were successful/failed/canceled/live in each country. Another possibility is creating a table/graph showing how much total money was pledged in each category and how many total bankers there were for each category. Lastly, we could create a table/graph displaying how many of each category of campaign came from each country.

### **Bonus Statistical Analysis:**

The median summarizes the data more meaningfully for both the successful and failed campaigns. This is because both types of campaigns have a large amount of outliers- 244 for successful campaigns and 192 for failed campaigns. This means that many data points are far away from the average of each data set. Because the mean is sensitive to outliers, it gets skewed by all of those outliers, making it not a meaningful central tendency to use. Because the median is not sensitive to outliers, it is more meaningful in these two cases. This concept can be visualized in the two histograms provided. Both types of campaigns have the vast majority of bankers in the first frequency group.

There is more variability with successful campaigns. This makes sense because the more bankers a campaign has, the more likely it is to raise enough money and be successful. This means it is more likely for the successful campaigns to have a larger amount of bankers than the failed campaigns. This causes the data set to have more variability than failed campaigns, who generally have less bankers.
